Machine learning project to predict supply chain shipment pricing

# Shipment Pricing Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict supply chain shipment pricing using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors affecting shipment costs, we develop a model that can accurately estimate pricing, helping supply chain organizations optimize their operations and reduce costs.

## Problem Statement
The supply chain analytics market is growing rapidly, with a projected CAGR of 17.3% from 2019 to 2024. This growth highlights the increasing importance of predictive analytics in supply chain management. Our goal is to create a reliable model for predicting shipment pricing, which can assist in addressing supply chain challenges, reducing costs, and improving service levels.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Cassandra Database
- Flask/FastAPI for API development
- Cloud platform (AWS/Azure/GCP) for deployment
